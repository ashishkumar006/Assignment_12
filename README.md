# GPT Text Generator

This project is a GPT-based text generator built using a custom GPT model. It uses Gradio for creating an interactive web-based interface, allowing users to input text prompts and receive generated text completions.

---

## Features
- **Custom GPT Model**: Utilizes a fine-tuned GPT model.
- **Interactive Gradio Interface**: Allows for text input and configuration of generation parameters.
- **Multiple Samples**: Generate multiple completions for the same input.
- **Predefined Examples**: Provides example prompts that can be used for quick testing.
- **Adjustable Parameters**:
  - Maximum new tokens to generate.
  - Number of samples to generate.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` for installing dependencies

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the model checkpoint file and place it in the project directory. Update the path in the script (`app.py`) if necessary:
   ```python
   model_path = r"path_to_your_model/model_epoch_152.pt"
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:7860/`.

## Usage

### Inputs
- **Input Text**: Enter the text you want the model to continue.
- **Maximum New Tokens**: Adjust the number of tokens to generate.
- **Number of Samples**: Select how many different completions to generate.

### Outputs
- **Generated Text**: The text generated by the model based on the input prompt and parameters.

### Examples
The interface provides predefined example prompts. Clicking on an example will populate the input text field, and the corresponding output will be generated automatically.

## Model Details
The project uses a custom GPT model fine-tuned for text generation. It supports dynamic input and generates coherent completions based on user prompts. While similar to OpenAI's GPT models, this implementation is entirely custom-built.

---

## Key Libraries
- **PyTorch**: For loading and running the GPT model.
- **Gradio**: For creating the web-based user interface.
- **tiktoken**: For tokenizing and decoding text.

---

## Notes
- The model is designed to handle text inputs efficiently but may encounter limitations based on the size of the input text.
- Ensure that the model checkpoint file is correctly loaded before running the application.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multilingual text generation.
- Optimize the model for faster inference.
- Enhance the interface with additional customization options.
